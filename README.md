**Logistical Performance Dashboard**

In this project, I used Excel to create an interactive dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for a logistics company. The dashboard allows the user to filter and analyze data by different criteria, such as time period, region, vehicle type, and driver. The dashboard also provides visualizations of the data, such as charts, tables, and maps, to help the user identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

**The main objectives of this project were to:**

- Demonstrate my proficiency in using Excel functions, formulas, and features, such as pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, data validation, and VLOOKUP.
- Apply data analysis and visualization techniques to transform raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.
- Showcase my creativity and attention to detail in designing a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing dashboard.

The data source for this project was a the company's internal tracking and ERP dataset of 10,000 records that contained information about the company's fleet performance, such as revenue, mileage, fuel consumption, maintenance cost, and customer satisfaction. I imported the data into Excel and performed data cleaning and validation to ensure its accuracy and consistency. I then created a data model and a pivot table to summarize and aggregate the data by various dimensions and measures. I used slicers to enable the user to filter the data interactively and dynamically. I also created charts and tables to visualize the data and highlight the KPIs, such as average revenue per mile, fuel efficiency, and customer satisfaction rating. I used conditional formatting to apply color scales and icons to the data to indicate its performance level. I also used data validation to create drop-down lists and input boxes to allow the user to select and enter values for the data analysis. Finally, I used Bing Maps to create a map that shows the geographic distribution of the company's revenue and mileage by region.

The dashboard consists of various worksheets: OPS Dashboard, Yearly Revenue and Monthly Mileage Performance. The OPS Dashboard worksheet provides a summary of the overall daily, monthly and yearly performance of the company, such as total revenue, total mileage, average revenue per month, and average truck daily commentary. The Yearly Revenue worksheet provides a detailed analysis of the revenue performance by different criteria, such as months, vehicle registration, and driver. The Mileage worksheet provides a detailed analysis of the mileage performance by different criteria, such as kilometres covered, Average monthly mileage covered, and target vs actual performances. The dashboard also has a navigation bar that allows the user to switch between the worksheets easily and intuitively.

The dashboard is intended to help the directors and stakeholders of the logistics company to monitor and evaluate the performance of their fleet, identify areas of improvement and opportunity, and make informed and strategic business decisions. The dashboard is also designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that it can accommodate different scenarios and preferences of the user. The dashboard is a powerful and practical tool that showcases my skill in using Excel for data analysis and visualization.
